# Explanation:

#     Initialization:

#         The class takes a string of email addresses during initialization.

#     parse() method:

#         Uses re.split() with the pattern [,\s]+ to split on either commas or whitespace

#         The strip() ensures we don't get empty strings from leading/trailing delimiters

#         Filters results using a regex pattern to ensure only valid emails are included

#         Converts to a set to remove duplicates, then back to a list and sorts it

#     Email Validation:

#         The regex pattern ensures:

#             Starts with a letter [A-Za-z]

#             Followed by valid characters [A-Za-z0-9._%+-]*

#             Contains an @ symbol

#             Has a valid domain with a top-level domain of at least 2 characters
